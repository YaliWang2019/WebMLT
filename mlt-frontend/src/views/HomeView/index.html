          <h1 id="regression">Regression Type</h1>
          <p>Regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable 
            (also known as the response variable or outcome variable) and one or more independent variables 
            (also known as predictor variables or features). The goal of regression analysis is to find the 
            best-fitting mathematical model that can predict the dependent variable's value based on the independent variables' values.
            Regression models are used to study the relationship between variables, make predictions about the 
            values of the dependent variable, and identify the key factors that influence the dependent variable.</p>

          <h1 id="categorical">Categorical Type</h1>
          <p>Categorical models are a type of statistical models used to analyze and predict categorical data, 
            which are data that can be divided into discrete categories or groups. The goal of categorical modeling 
            is to identify the relationships between the categorical dependent variable (also known as the response variable) 
            and one or more categorical or continuous independent variables (also known as predictor variables or features).</p>

          <h1 id="unsupervised">Unsupervised Type</h1>
          <p>Unsupervised models are a type of machine learning model used to analyze and find patterns in unlabeled data, 
            meaning data without any predefined labels or categories. Unlike supervised learning models, unsupervised models 
            do not have a target variable to predict. Instead, try to identify patterns or structures in the data based 
            on the inherent relationships between the variables.</p>
          <p>There are various types of unsupervised models, including clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction algorithms, 
            and anomaly detection algorithms. Clustering algorithms group similar data points into clusters based on their similarity. 
            Dimensionality reduction algorithms reduce the number of variables in the data while retaining the most important information, 
            and anomaly detection algorithms identify data points significantly different from the rest of the data.</p>
